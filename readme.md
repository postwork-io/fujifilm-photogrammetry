# Photogrammetry Capture

I want to be able to capture reliable high quality source photographs for creating 3D models for a project I am working on.

I want to explore a few techniques that would be tedious to achieve manually but easily automated.

- Be able to automatically pull images off of the camera without needing to remove memory cards etc.
- Move the scanned object on a turntable to gather multiple views.
- Capture images at multiple focus distances and combine them to create completely in focus view of the object.
- Use cross polarized light to get an accurate diffuse color of the object and improve image alignment for 3d scanning.
- Also capture an regular image and compare to the cross polarized image to extract images with only specular contributions.
- Do all image processing automatically as the images are being captured.


The current stage is a proof of concept with a bit of jank but we are able to test the whole process end to end. More details and design documentation of steps to move the POC to something more stable to come, probably.
